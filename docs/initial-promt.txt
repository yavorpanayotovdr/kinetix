Kinetix


Modern risk management system for big financial institutions, e.g. big investment banks and hedge funds.

Plan the design of such a system. Take into account following:
- Multi-module system with the ability for it to be deployed locally via docker-compose
- System will leverage AI for risk calculation (preferably through python integration)
- Most of the backend services will be written in Kotlin 
- System will benefit from modern UI
- Observability of key metrics is a core requirement
- System will be build incrementally with testing in mind. Every change will start with a failing test and all tests will be run before a commit. Testing strategies to be deployed - unit, acceptance, integration, performance 

Think harder!
