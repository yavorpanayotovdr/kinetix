# ALP-13: Expression-form config defaults

## Problem

ALP-10 introduced bare qualified references in config defaults (`param: Type = other/config.param`), allowing config parameters to alias values from imported modules. The ALP-10 panel adopted bare references but deferred expression-form defaults, which combine qualified references with arithmetic to express derived configuration values.

Without expression-form defaults, a module that needs a timeout twice as long as its dependency's base timeout must declare an unrelated literal value. The relationship between the two parameters is invisible to both readers and tooling. A PBT generator deriving entity generators bounded by config values cannot follow the relationship to produce tighter test bounds.

## Proposed construct

Allow config parameter defaults to be expressions that combine qualified config references, local config references and literal values with arithmetic operators.

```allium
use "./core.allium" as core

config {
    base_timeout: Duration = core/config.base_timeout          -- bare reference (ALP-10)
    extended_timeout: Duration = core/config.base_timeout * 2  -- expression-form
    buffer_size: Integer = core/config.batch_size + 10         -- expression-form
    retry_limit: Integer = max_attempts - 1                    -- local reference in expression
}
```

Expression-form defaults use arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) with standard precedence. Both operands must resolve to type-compatible values.

## Semantics

### Resolution

Expression-form defaults resolve in the same order as bare references (ALP-10): explicit override wins, then the expression is evaluated using the resolved values of any referenced parameters. The expression is evaluated once at config resolution time, not re-evaluated dynamically.

### Local and qualified references

Both local config parameter references (`base_timeout * 2`) and qualified references (`core/config.base_timeout * 2`) are permitted in expressions. This avoids the irregularity the ALP-10 panel identified: if only qualified references were allowed in expressions, they would behave differently from local references, which is an unjustified asymmetry.

A local reference in an expression-form default creates a dependency between parameters within the same config block. The acyclicity rule (ALP-10 amendment 1) applies: the config reference graph, including both cross-module and local edges, must be a DAG.

## Open questions from ALP-10 deferral

The ALP-10 panel identified four questions that this proposal must address:

### 1. Type semantics

What does `Duration * 2` mean?

`Duration * Integer` produces a `Duration`. `Integer * Integer` produces an `Integer`. `Duration + Duration` produces a `Duration`. `Duration * Duration` is a type error. These rules match the existing expression language's type semantics for arithmetic in rule bodies and derived values.

The full type compatibility table for config default expressions:

| Left | Operator | Right | Result |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| Integer | `+` `-` `*` `/` | Integer | Integer |
| Duration | `+` `-` | Duration | Duration |
| Duration | `*` `/` | Integer | Duration |
| Integer | `*` | Duration | Duration |

All other combinations are type errors.

### 2. Local references

Permitted. See "Local and qualified references" above.

### 3. Grammar impact

Config default position currently accepts: literal values (ALP-10: also qualified references). This proposal extends it to accept expressions. The parser must handle qualified references and local references in expression position within config blocks.

The grammar change is contained: the config default production becomes `default_value := literal | qualified_ref | expression`, where `expression` uses the same operator precedence as the existing expression language. The `/config.` infix in qualified references remains a unique structural signal that disambiguates qualified references from other identifiers.

### 4. Conceptual boundary

Config blocks with expression-form defaults are no longer purely declarative. They become a restricted computation layer: aliases (bare references) and derived values (expressions) over config parameters. This proposal accepts that shift as intentional. The restriction to arithmetic operators and config references prevents config blocks from becoming a general-purpose expression context. They remain a configuration assembly mechanism, not a rule evaluation context.

## Validation rules to add

51. Expression-form config defaults must use only arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), literal values, local config parameter references and qualified config references
52. Both sides of an arithmetic operator in a config default must resolve to type-compatible operands per the type compatibility table above

## Error catalogue

### E8: Invalid config default expression

**Trigger**: A config default expression uses an operator or construct beyond arithmetic and config references.

**Diagnostic**: "Config default expressions support arithmetic operators and config references only. 'slots.count' is not a valid config default expression."

### E9: Type-incompatible config default expression

**Trigger**: An arithmetic operator is applied to operands whose types are not in the compatibility table.

**Diagnostic**: "Cannot apply '*' to Duration and Duration. Duration can be multiplied by Integer, not by another Duration."

## Questions for the committee

1. Should expression-form defaults support boolean expressions (e.g. `enabled: Boolean = core/config.feature_flag and env/config.is_production`), or should they be restricted to arithmetic?
2. Should parenthesised sub-expressions be permitted for explicit precedence (`(base + 1) * 2`), or should expressions be flat?
3. Is the type compatibility table above complete, or should it include other type combinations (e.g. `Integer + Duration` producing `Duration`)?

## Committee review

**Status: adopted with amendments.**

All nine panellists supported the proposal. No panellist objected. The proposal successfully addressed all four questions deferred from ALP-10.

### Amendments

1. **Permit parenthesised sub-expressions.** Parentheses are part of the existing expression language; excluding them from config defaults creates an artificial context-dependent restriction. Without parentheses, some expressions cannot be written (`(a + b) * c` has no flat equivalent). Required for compositional completeness.

2. **Complete the type compatibility table.** Two gaps:
   - `Integer / Integer` produces `Integer`. Integer division uses truncation toward zero, consistent with the existing expression language.
   - `Decimal` type interactions must be added: `Decimal +/-/*// Decimal -> Decimal`, `Decimal * Integer -> Decimal`, `Decimal / Integer -> Decimal`, `Integer * Decimal -> Decimal`, mirroring the Duration rows. `Decimal * Decimal` produces `Decimal`. `Duration * Decimal` should be specified or explicitly excluded.

3. **Arithmetic-only is a design boundary, not a starting point.** The restriction to arithmetic operators reflects the domain reality that config relationships are quantitative. Boolean config parameters are toggles that rarely derive from other toggles. Whether to extend config expressions to boolean logic is a separate design question warranting its own ALP if a concrete need arises. The proposal should not frame arithmetic-only as provisional.

### Answers to committee questions

1. **Boolean expressions.** Restricted to arithmetic only. The arithmetic boundary reflects the quantitative nature of config relationships. If boolean config expressions are needed, they warrant their own proposal.
2. **Parenthesised sub-expressions.** Permitted (see amendment 1).
3. **Type compatibility table.** Incomplete as written. Needs integer division semantics and `Decimal` type interactions (see amendment 2).

### Resolution of ALP-10 deferred questions

1. **Type semantics.** Addressed. The type compatibility table specifies mixed-type arithmetic precisely, with amendments to complete it.
2. **Local references.** Addressed. Both local and qualified references are permitted, avoiding the irregularity the ALP-10 panel identified. The acyclicity rule extends uniformly to both.
3. **Grammar impact.** Addressed. The grammar change is contained: the config default production extends to accept expressions with the same operator precedence as the existing language.
4. **Conceptual boundary.** Addressed. Config blocks become a restricted computation layer. The restriction to arithmetic and config references prevents them from becoming a general-purpose expression context.
